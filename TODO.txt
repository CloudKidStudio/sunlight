PARSING
- PHP class name highlighting in use statements
- C# class name highlighting in using aliases
- CSS property values (none, solid, inset, etc.)

TESTING

BUGS
- getNextNonWsToken() doesn't really work correctly: it needs to completely ignore whitespace tokens
  when incrementing/decrementing
- if heredoc/nowdoc isn't closed (e.g. EOF is reached) it will print "undefined"
	- this might occur in other parse rules as well
