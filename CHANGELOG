1.3 2001-04-13
--------------
- Bugfixes
	- fixed bug in number parsing where decimals with more than one digit to the right of the decimal
	  point were not being parsed as numbers (oops)
	- fixed bug where code with trailing newlines had too many line numbers (more specifically, browsers
	  don't render the last trailing newline, so neither will we), doesn't work in IE6, too bad
- Enhancements
	- PHP class names after instanceof are highlighted as named idents
	- new languages: bash, tsql, python, ruby, java
	- added line highlighting via linHighlight option
