1.5 2011-04-xx
--------------
- Bugfixes
	- fixed bug where keywords were being spuriously detected in idents (e.g. "class" in "cclass")
	  due to the fact that the regular expression in the generated hashmap was not requiring the match
	  to start at the beginning of the string (with "^")
	- made default number parser better (don't allow multiple decimal places, and don't allow decimal point
	  in octal/hex numbers)
	- fixed bug in C# attribute detection where it would falsely identify the namespace portion of a fully
	  qualified type name
- Enhancements
	- new languages: VB.NET, httpd, Lisp
	  
1.4 2011-04-17
--------------
- Bugfixes
	- fixed bug in number parsing where it would incorrectly parse 1. as the number "1." rather
	  than the number "1" followed by a "."
	- fixed bug where casts were being falsely detected in expressions like "if (something) doSomething();"
	  in Java and C#
- Enhancements
	- new languages: brainfuck (awwwwwwww yeeeeeeeeeah), nginx, c/c++, 6502 assembler, perl
	- added getNextWhile/getPreviousWhile utility functions
	- added isSol() and isEol() functions to reader

1.3 2011-04-13
--------------
- Bugfixes
	- fixed bug in number parsing where decimals with more than one digit to the right of the decimal
	  point were not being parsed as numbers (oops)
	- fixed bug where code with trailing newlines had too many line numbers (more specifically, browsers
	  don't render the last trailing newline, so neither will we), doesn't work in IE6, too bad
- Enhancements
	- PHP class names after instanceof are highlighted as named idents
	- new languages: bash, tsql, python, ruby, java
	- added line highlighting via lineHighlight option

1.2 2011-04-09
--------------
- Bugfixes
	- fixed undefined bug that could occur when parsing C#
- Enhancements
	- added plaintext language
	- unregistered languages will be rendered as plaintext rather than throwing an error
	- horizontal scrolling enabled via css for browsers that aren't IE6
	- added line number permalinks (no IE6, no quirks mode)

1.1 2011-04-08
--------------
- Enhancmenets
	- CSS
		- added vertical-align keyword
		- added zoom keyword
	- C#
		- use type definition naming convention (^T([A-Z0-9]\w*)?$) to make sure generic type 
		  definitions (e.g. T) are not named idents
	
- Bugfixes
	- C#
		- fixed false positive named ident detection for generics
		- custom named ident rules in threw errors if the first token of the string was an ident
		- attribute names weren't being recognized as named idents if it was the first  token
		- don't highlight "Resolve" in "container.Resolve<Foo>()", i.e. a generic method invocation
		- fixed named ident false positive for array access, e.g. foo.Bar[0].Name had "Bar" as a named ident
	- PHP/C#
		- fixed named ident detection for fully qualified class names
	- CSS
		- fixed issues with element selectors not being highlighted correctly
