PARSING
- PHP class name highlighting in use statements
- C# class name highlighting in using aliases
- CSS property values (none, solid, inset, etc.)

TESTING

BUGS
- getNextNonWsToken() doesn't really work correctly: it needs to completely ignore whitespace tokens
  when incrementing/decrementing
- if heredoc/nowdoc isn't closed (e.g. EOF is reached) it will print "undefined"
	- this might occur in other parse rules as well
- C#:
	- expression.Parameters[0].Name has Parameters as a named ident
	- new NHibernate.Cfg.Configuration() has NHibernate as a named ident (same for fully qualified stuff in PHP)
	- public static IEnumerable<T> Walk<T>(this IEnumerable<T> source, Action<T> action)
		- Walk and source are named idents

FUNCTIONALITY
