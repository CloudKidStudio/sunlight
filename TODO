PARSING
- PHP class name highlighting in use statements
- C# class name highlighting in using aliases
- CSS property values (none, solid, inset, etc.)

TESTING

BUGS
- getNextNonWsToken() doesn't really work correctly: it needs to completely ignore whitespace tokens
  when incrementing/decrementing
- PHP:
	- fully qualified class names aren't colored correctly
	- if heredoc/nowdoc isn't closed (e.g. EOF is reached) it will print "undefined"
		- this might occur in other parse rules as well

FUNCTIONALITY
- customizable class prefix
- customizable number parsing
- code folding
- line number permalinks
- show/hide code block
- "plain" language
- line highlighting (?)
- PHP constants like PREG_OFFSET_CAPTURE

- use naming convention to not color generic definitions (T, T1, TFrom, etc.)
